## Set-up

- Fork and clone the repo
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to develop

- The HTML and CSS have been supplied if you wish to focus on the programming and not the UI, but you should feel free to customise your application as you see fit.

## Objectives

Using the API keys, HTML & CSS from [Mini Weather App](https://github.com/constructorlabs/mini-weatherapp), covert the HTML into React components (stateful and stateless) and write the data loading logic to make requests to the Open Weather and Unsplash APIs

## Support

- If you are stuck for more than 20 minutes, ask us for help.
- There is a completed version on the branch `stage/complete`
